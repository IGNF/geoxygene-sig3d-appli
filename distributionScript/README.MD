# Scripts for distribution

These scripts were developed to allow the distribution of Profile process through OpenMole from BDTopo Databse. 


-PrepareBase.sh : creation of database structure and import of BDTopo data
- Export.sh : export the data into a set of folder with necessary data (attention : it is very long)
- Distribution.oms : script to distribute the task (defined in Java project as ProfilTask) for OpenMole
